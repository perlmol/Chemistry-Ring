Chemistry::Ring version 0.19
============================

The Chemistry::Ring module provides some basic methods for representing a ring.
A ring is a subclass of molecule, because it has atoms and bonds. Besides that,
it has some useful geometric methods for finding the centroid and the ring
plane, and methods for aromaticity detection.

The Chemistry::Ring::Find module implements a breadth-first ring finding
algorithm, and it can find all rings that contain a given atom or bond, the
Smallest Set of Smallest Rings (SSSR), or the "almost SSSR", which is an
unambiguous set of rings for cases such as cubane.

This module is part of the PerlMol project, L<http://www.perlmol.org/>.

CHANGES SINCE VERSION 0.18
    - Fixed memory leak.
    - Added 'ring/rings' attribute to molecule on aromatize_mol.
